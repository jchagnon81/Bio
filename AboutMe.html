                <p>My name is Rachael, and <strong>I love coding</strong>. I was born in Seattle, WA and lived there for about 18 years. In Washington state, there is lots of rain and clouds. It can be depressing, but I loved it! The only reason why I am now in Colorado is because I love the <em>snow</em> even more!</p>
